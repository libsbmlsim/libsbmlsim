Tutorial

BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim is available as a command-line program and as
a command-line program encapsulated into a Docker image.

Creating COMBINE/OMEX archives and encoding simulation experiments
into SED-ML

Information about how to create COMBINE/OMEX archives which can be
executed by BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim is available at

BioSimulators

.

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by
LibSBMLSim is available at

BioSimulators

.

Models (SBML)

BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim can execute models encoded in SBML format.

Simulation experiments (SED-ML, KISAO)

BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim can execute simulation experiments encoded in
SED-ML, using KiSAO to indicate specific algorithms and their
parameters. Information about the algorithms (KiSAO terms), algorithm
parameters (KiSAO terms), and outputs (XML XPaths for variables)
supported by BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim is available from the

BioSimulators registry

.

Example COMBINE/OMEX archives

Examples of COMBINE/OMEX archives for simulations which BioSimulators-
LibSBMLSim can execute are available in the

BioSimulators test suite

.

Command-line program

The command-line program can be used to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives
that describe simulations as illustrated below.

   usage: biosimulators-libsbmlsim [-h] [-d] [-q] -i ARCHIVE [-o OUT_DIR] [-v]

   BioSimulators-compliant command-line interface to the LibSBMLSim <https://fun.bio.keio.ac.jp/software/libsbmlsim/> simulation program.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -d, --debug           full application debug mode
     -q, --quiet           suppress all console output
     -i ARCHIVE, --archive ARCHIVE
                           Path to OMEX file which contains one or more SED-ML-
                           encoded simulation experiments
     -o OUT_DIR, --out-dir OUT_DIR
                           Directory to save outputs
     -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

For example, the following command could be used to execute the
simulations described in "./modeling-study.omex" and save their
results to "./":

   biosimulators-libsbmlsim -i ./modeling-study.omex -o ./

Docker image with a command-line entrypoint

The entrypoint to the Docker image supports the same command-line
interface described above.

For example, the following command could be used to use the Docker
image to execute the same simulations described in "./modeling-
study.omex" and save their results to "./":

   docker run \
       --tty \
       --rm \
       --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd),target=/tmp/working-dir \
       ghcr.io/biosimulators/libsbmlsim:latest \
           -i /tmp/working-dir/modeling-study.omex \
           -o /tmp/working-dir
