BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim documentation

BioSimulators-LibSBMLSim provides a

BioSimulators

-compliant command-line interface to the

LibSBMLSim

 simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use
LibSBMLSim to execute

COMBINE/OMEX archives

 that describe one or more simulation experiments (in

SED-ML format

) of one or more kinetic models in SBML format.

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by
LibSBMLSim is available at

BioSimulators

.

A simple web application and web service for using LibSBMLSim to
execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at

runBioSimulations
